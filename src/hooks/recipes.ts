Use a  cup measuring cup to size how much meat to use when forming your patties.  Place meat on tinfoil and press gently with your thumb creating a small indent in the center. This will help keep patties from shrinking when cooking.</li><li>Pre-heat the barbecue to high temperature.</li><li>I recommend leaving the elk burgers on the tinfoil while cooking on the BBQ. The elk meat is very lean and can have the tendency to dry out if overcooked. Cooking on tinfoil reduces the risk of overcooking.</li><li>Cook 7 minutes or until brown and then flip patties. Continue cooking on other side until brown  7 minutes. Add smoked mozzarella cheese to the top of burgers during the last 2 minutes of cooking.

        "Wash the chicken inside and out and pat dry. Make sure the skin is nice and dry so the skin gets crispy. Season well with salt and pepper inside, out and under the skin.\nMix the butter with the garlic, chilli and lemon rind. Season a bit with salt and pepper. Stuff the flavoured butter under the skin over the breast, legs and back. Stuff the lemon half into the cavity.\nPre-heat the oven to 400F. Toss the two kinds of potatoes in the bottom the the baking pan with the chilli, salt and pepper to taste and a generous helping of olive oil. Place a rack over the vegetables. Position the chicken breast side up on the rack.\nBake for the first 15 minutes at 400F. Then drop the temperature and continue to cook for about an hour at 300F.\nHalfway through cooking turn the chicken on its breast. Spoon over some of the juices.\nLater, to check for doneness, pierce the thickest part of the chicken (the thigh). If the juices run clear the chicken is ready, if not continue cooking.\nServe chicken on a platter on the bed of roasted potatoes.",

        "Preheat oven to 425 degrees Farenheit.\nSpread chopped cauliflower, leeks and garlic on baking sheet.\nDrizzle olive oil on vegetables and mix well to thoroughly coat.  Sprinkle with kosher salt.\nRoast in oven for 40-45 minutes.  Vegetables should be brown on edges and slightly softened.\nPour roasted vegetables into a saucepan and add 2 cans of chicken broth and fresh ground pepper to taste.\nOver medium high heat, heat vegetables and  broth until it bubbles.\nUsing an immersion blender (stick blender), thoroughly puree all contents of the saucepan.  If you don't have an immersion blender, you can use a regular blender.  Just be careful putting hot liquids in a blender as they can cause the lid to come flying off sending your yummy soup all over your kitchen.  (You can vent the lid a little to help reduce the chance of this happening.)",

      instructions:
        "Season both sides of the corned beef liberally with pepper. The corning of the beef makes the beef salty enough, so no need to add more.\nHeat 1 TBSP oil in a large, shallow oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear each side for about 3 minutes, just to develop a nice brown crust. This will seal in the beef's juices.\nRemove beef to a plate. Pour guinness into the pot to deglaze. Scrape up any browned bits. Add beef broth, pickling spice, brown sugar, bay leaf, and minced garlic. Bring mixture up to a simmer.\nReturn the beef to the pot with any additional juices that have accumulated on the plate.\nCover the pot and place on the bottom rack in your oven. Bake for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or until a fork can easily be inserted into the meat.\nBaste the meat with the surrounding juices every 30 minutes or so.\nAfter 2 hours, add carrots, parsnips, and potatoes to the pot. They will only take about 25-30 minutes of simmering to cook.\nRemove pot from the oven. Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened. Place the cabbage on the serving platter with the other vegetables.\nStrain the sauce in the pot and stir in 2 or 3 TBSP of spicy honey mustard until dissolved. Place in a small dish or gravy boat with a ladle and serve alongside the beef.\nAfter slicing the beef and arranging it on the serving platter, ladle the guinness mustard sauce over the top to rehydrate and glaze the beef and vegetables.",
